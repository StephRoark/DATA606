## Part 1 - Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the most dreaded and deadly cancer diagnosis that woman can receive. For women in the U.S., breast cancer death rates are higher than those for any other cancer, besides lung cancer. Many institutions have dedicated years of research into improving the survival chances of breast cancer patients and there has been a measure of improvement in the new incidence rates since 2000. Treatment advances, earlier detection through screening, and increased awareness are all key factors in surviving breast cancer and the emergence of machine learning in medical research is an important step in detecting and predicting malignant tumors.

Each year it is estimated that over 252,710 US women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. About 1 in 8 US women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. Invasive cancer, or Stage-4 breast cancer, is also called metastatic breast cancer. Metastasis happens when cancer cells migrate from the breast elsewhere in the body, triggering cancerous growth and is terminal meaning there is no cure. More than 40,000 US women a year die from metastatic breast cancer and that number has not changed since 1970. Research enabling earlier detection of malignancy is imperative to the survival of women diagnosed with breast cancer.

Tests such as MRI, mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy are commonly used to diagnose breast cancer. Dr. William H. Wolberg, a physician at the University Of Wisconsin Hospital at Madison, created a dataset using Fine Needle Aspiration biopsies to collect samples from patients with solid breast masses and a computer vision approach known as "snakes" to compute values for each of ten characteristics of each nuclei, measuring size, shape and texture. The mean, standard error and extreme values of these features are computed, resulting in a total of 30 nuclear features for each sample.

Using this dataset we can examine the observations of the biospies and investigate whether there are any variables or any combination of the variables which are predictors for a malignant or benign diagnosis.

## Part 2 - Data

```{r data, include=FALSE}

library(psych)
library(ggplot2)
library(corrplot)
library(bestglm)
library(caret)
library(rsq)
library(tidyverse)

bc_data <- read.csv("wisc_bc_data.csv")

#create bucket variable for radius mean which is either top half or bottom half
bc_data <- bc_data %>% 
    mutate(radius_mean_size = ifelse(radius_mean < 19.7,"bottom half", "top half") )

str(bc_data)
``` 

###Data collection: 

The features in this dataset characterise cell nucleus properties and were generated from image analysis of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. Dr. William H. Wolberg collected samples from `r nrow(bc_data)` patients with solid breast masses and computed values for each of ten characteristics of each nuclei, measuring size, shape and texture including the mean, standard error and extreme values of these features.

###Cases: 

Each case represents an individual sample or observation of tissue taken from a biopsy of a breast mass. There `r nrow(bc_data)` observations in the given dataset. 

###Variables: 

####Dependent Variable

The response variable is the diagnosis which is a qualitative binary categorical variable of either benign or malignant.

####Independent Variables

There are 30 independent variables which are quantitative and an additional variable conputed from radius_mean called radius_mean_size is a qualitative variable that describes the size of the mass as being in the bottom half or top half of the size range. The variables are all aspects of the tissue samples and include the mean, standard error and worst case for each variable.

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus: 

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 
c) perimeter 
d) area 
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) 
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) 
i) symmetry 
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

All feature values are recoded with four significant digits. There are no missing data.

THe class distribution of the data are 357 benign and 212 malignant observations. 

###Type of study: 
What is the type of study, observational or an experiment? Explain how youâ€™ve arrived at your conclusion using information on the sampling and/or experimental design.

This study is an observational study of the biopsied breast tissue mass. The sample were taken as a result of mass detection and not as a part of an experimental study. They were collected as part of a medicial procedure conducted to examine the breast mass tissue in an attempt to diagnos the mass as benign or malignant.

###Scope of inference - generalizability: 
Identify the population of interest, and whether the findings from this analysis can be generalized to that population, or, if not, a subsection of that population. Explain why or why not. Also discuss any potential sources of bias that might prevent generalizability.

###Scope of inference - causality: 
Can these data be used to establish causal links between the variables of interest? Explain why or why not.

## Part 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis

Perform relevant descriptive statistics, including summary statistics and visualization of the data. Also address what the exploratory data analysis suggests about your research question.

```{r summary, include=FALSE}
#check for missing values and summary statistics
summary(bc_data)

describe(bc_data %>% select(-id, -diagnosis))
#how many benign and malignant observations
table(bc_data$diagnosis)
```

There are no missing values.

Boxplots of the 10 mean variables vs. diagnosis:

```{r plots}

boxplot(radius_mean ~ diagnosis, data = bc_data)
boxplot(texture_mean ~ diagnosis, data = bc_data)
boxplot(perimeter_mean ~ diagnosis, data = bc_data)
boxplot(area_mean ~ diagnosis, data = bc_data)
boxplot(smoothness_mean ~ diagnosis, data = bc_data)
boxplot(compactness_mean ~ diagnosis, data = bc_data)

boxplot(concave_points_mean ~ diagnosis, data = bc_data)

```


###Model Probability



## Part 4 - Inference

Logistic Regression is used for modeling when there is a categorical response variable with two levels. Logistic regression is a Generalized Linear Model 

###Check conditions

Conditions for Logistic Regression:

 - Each predictor is linearly related to the logut(pi) if all other predictors are held constant.
 - Each outcome Yi is independent of the other outcomes.

###Theoretical inference - 
####Hypothesis Test and Confidence Intervals

H0 = All variables (individually or in combination) are good predictors for benign or malignant diagnosis.
H1 = There is a specific variable or combination of variables which are good predictors for benign or malignant diagnosis.


```{r glm,include=FALSE}

bc_data_no_id <- bc_data %>% select(-id)
#this model doesn't do a great job of eliminating variables, 24 left, but has a good AIC
bc_model_AIC <- glm(diagnosis ~ ., data = bc_data_no_id, 
                family=binomial, control = list(maxit = 100))

bc_mode.step <- stepAIC(bc_model_AIC, direction = "both")
bc_mode.step$anova
```

###GLM for all variables

Generalized linear models (GLMs) are an extension of linear models to model non-normal response variables.
Logistic regression is for binary response variables, where there are two possible outcomes.

```{r glm all}
plot(bc_mode.step)
summary(bc_mode.step)
#plot the deviance residuals of the step glm model
plot(residuals(bc_mode.step))
```

take genetic model and look at each variable selected for high sd and high p-value - run several times selecting out the best variables from the resulting models, select out those variables and then rerun in regular or best glm (hopefully a certain set will tend to show everytime you run the model)

2^30 ways to do different possible model combinations, computationally infeasible, must do model selection taking into account the high correlation between variables, which means there are lots of combinations that would make good models

###Deviance Residual Plots for all Variables Modeled Independently Against Diagnosis 

The deviance residual is useful for determining if individual points are not well fit by the model. The deviance residual for the ith observation is the signed square root of the contribution of the ith case to the sum for the model deviance, DEV .

In standard linear models, we estimate the parameters by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals.
Equivalent to finding parameters that maximize the likelihood. In a GLM we also fit parameters by maximizing the likelihood. Estimation is equivalent to finding parameter values that minimize the deviance.

```{r step_model plots}
plot(residuals(bc_model_step1))
plot(residuals(bc_model_step2))
plot(residuals(bc_model_step3))
plot(residuals(bc_model_step4))

###Methods for Selecting Variables

###Examine the Correlation of the Variables 

Often we have variables that are highly correlated and therefore redundant. By eliminating highly correlated features we can avoid a predictive bias for the information contained in these features. 

```{R cor}
corMatMy <- cor(bc_data[,3:32])
corrplot(corMatMy, order = "hclust", tl.cex = 0.7)
```

Correlations between all features are calculated and visualised with the corrplot package. ##I will consider removing all features with a correlation higher than 0.7, keeping the feature with the lower mean.##


####AIC - Akaike Information Criterion

Akaike information criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1974) is a fined technique based on in-sample fit to estimate the likelihood of a model to predict/estimate the future values.

A good model is the one that has minimum AIC among all the other models. The AIC can be used to select between the additive and multiplicative Holt-Winters models.

Bayesian information criterion (BIC) (Stone, 1979) is another criteria for model selection that measures the trade-off between model fit and complexity of the model. A lower AIC or BIC value indicates a better fit.

The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is an estimator of the relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data. Given a collection of models for the data, AIC estimates the quality of each model, relative to each of the other models. Thus, AIC provides a means for model selection.

AIC is an estimate of a constant plus the relative distance between the unknown true likelihood function of the data and the fitted likelihood function of the model, so that a lower AIC means a model is considered to be closer to the truth.

AIC basic principles:

 - Lower indicates a more parsimonious model, relative to a model fit
with a higher AIC.

 - It is a relative measure of model parsimony, so it only has
meaning if we compare the AIC for alternate hypotheses (= different
models of the data).

 - The comparisons are only valid for models that are fit to the same response
data (ie values of y).

 - You shouldnâ€™t compare too many models with the AIC. You will run
into the same problems with multiple model comparison as you would
with p-values, in that you might by chance find a model with the
lowest AIC, that isnâ€™t truly the most appropriate model.

 - When using the AIC you might end up with multiple models that
perform similarly to each other. So you have similar evidence
weights for different alternate hypotheses.

### Genetic Algorithm

A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution. The genetic algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems that is based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution. The genetic algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions.

Using a genetic algorith to select the variables which best predict a benign or malignant outcome:
 
```{r genetic glm, include=FALSE}
#rearranging the variables for model input
bc_data_no_id <- bc_data %>% select(-id) %>%
  mutate(diagnosis_b=ifelse(diagnosis=="B",0,1)) %>%
  select(-diagnosis)
#model with predictors selected after many models examined to find the consistently chosen by stepwise AIC
glmulti.logistic.out <-
 glmulti(diagnosis_b ~ radius_mean + perimeter_mean + compactness_mean + concavity_mean + 
             symmetry_mean + concave_points_mean + radius_se + area_se + concave_points_se + 
             concavity_se + fractal_dimension_se + texture_worst + area_worst + symmetry_worst + 
             fractal_dimension_worst, 
            data = bc_data_no_id,
          level = 1,               # No interaction considered
          method = "g",            # Genetic algorithms search
          crit = "aic",            # AIC as criteria
          confsetsize = 20,        # Keep 20 best models
          plotty = F, report = T,  # No plot or interim reports
          fitfunction = "glm",     # glm function
          family = binomial,       # binomial family for logistic regression
          includeobjects = T )
